# Daily Diary Application

Mini project exploring how databases work.

## Description

I enjoy keeping a daily diary, and I want to store this online in my very own 'Daily Diary' application.

As a busy coach I'm a bit short on time, so I've provided user stories below so you can build one for me. Your challenge is to build a 'Daily Diary' application that uses a PostgreSQL to store diary entries, and a browser-based user interface, so that I can add to and read my daily diary.

I've included some extra functionality options, so the user requirements are split into 'Must have', 'Should have'  and 'Could have'.

If you can think if any other cool features then feel free to add them ðŸ˜ƒ

To get feedback on your approach, please submit a Code Review Request by the end of the week.
